# Smart Contracts

## What smart contracts are being used for The LAO?

The LAO uses various smart contracts to administer its activity. Primarily, the smart contracts are used to facilitate:

- collecting members' initial contributions to The LAO;
- voting;
- delegating voting to third parties;
- funding investments;
- distributing proceeds; and
- rage quitting.

The LAO currently uses v2 of the MolochDAO's smart contracts, which can be found [here](https://github.com/MolochVentures/moloch).

## How are the smart contracts related to MolochDAO?

OpenLaw, the initial service provider for The LAO, has worked with the MolochDAO to develop v2 of the MolochDAO smart contracts. More information about the collaboration can be found [here](https://medium.com/@thelaoofficial/the-lao-joins-forces-with-moloch-dao-and-metacartel-to-begin-to-standardize-dao-related-smart-b6ee4b0db071).

## Will The LAO smart contracts be audited?

The LAO smart contracts are currently being audited by [ConsenSys Diligence](https://diligence.consensys.net/), [MolochDAO](https://molochdao.com/), and [MetaCartel](https://www.metacartel.org/). Details on the auditing process will be made public shortly.

## Will the smart contract code be publicly available?

The LAO smart contract code will be publicly available on Etherscan and GitHub when it is complete.
